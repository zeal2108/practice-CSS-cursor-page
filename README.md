# Practice-CSS-cursor-page

This repository offers a **desktop-only static layout clone of the "www.cursor.com" landing page**, created using **only HTML and CSS**.

The project focuses purely on **structure, layout, typography, spacing, and visual hierarchy**, it is a desktop-only non-responsive web-page without any kind of interactivity.

## Project Goals

The primary goal of this clone is **practice**, not replication for production use.

Specifically, this project was created to:

- Strengthen understanding of **semantic HTML**
- Improve **CSS layout skills** (Flexbox / Grid)
- Practice **modern typography**
- Analyze and recreate **spacing, alignment, and visual structure**
- Learn how polished landing pages are structured at a CSS level

No frameworks, pre-processors, or libraries were used. 
Everything is written from scratch from a learner's perspective.
